정신을 차리고 발 밑을 내려다보니 한 장의 쪽지가 눈에 띄었다.
그 쪽지에는 이렇게 쓰여있었다.
"Hahaha.. Can you imagine where you are?
It's an uncrackable room and you will never escape!! hhh
All right. It seems that you look really pitiful.

So, I'll give you a little hint. If you follow the hint in right way, you will escape the room.
Or.. you will die in this dark and hopeless room.
Can you escape this room?
Try it! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

First hint
a = the number that you should type "change directory" to see this note directly after you git clone
REMEMBER. DIRECTLY. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!"
